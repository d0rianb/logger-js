`logger-js` is a npm logger library for NodeJS

This logger is primarly designed for a backend usage, to handle the logs of a node server, or for a bot. It's lighter and easier to use than other libraries and does not require any configuration (at least for a small/medium project). It's particulary fast and require almost no running time.

The logger will write the logs by default in the `logs/` directory to the root of your project. You can change the location and the name of this folder. The default log file is `logs.log`.

This project is part of the [vener.fr](http://www.vener.fr) project, to collect the errors and different information of the server ([express](https://www.expressjs.com)).


## Installation
To install the package, just run :
```bash
npm install --save @dorianb/logger-js
```

Then in the `.js` file :
```js
const Logger = require('@dorianb/logger-js')

Logger.info('Server is starting on port 9000')
Logger.debug('172 clients are currently connected')
Logger.warn('Unsafe call from client @7655671')
Logger.error('Socket &757@127.0.0.1 doesn\'t exist')
Logger.fatal('Internet connection lost')
```
